# LiveStreamCounter

## How it works
Viewers can join the stream and reset a stopwatch.

## Preresquites
* Streamer.bot
* OBS Studio with Aitum Vertical
* Any place to live stream

## Set-up
In streamer.bot, you will need to link the accounts that the stream will run on. After this, create a Trigger to run when !reset is typed. Then, create an Action to press o when the trigger is triggered. Now, show the Scratch Project that you hopefully came here from on stream. Start streaming and if everything worked, you have a working interactive stream.
